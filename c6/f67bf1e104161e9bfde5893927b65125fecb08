FYI I made the test fail first then fixed it...

`git checkout 36219af08f7cdbbff8c3ba14f83b406c7dc1510d && ./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testEncodingAndDecodingSamples tests/acceptance/Swift/Mime/ContentEncoder/Base64ContentEncoderAcceptanceTest.php`
FAILS

`git checkout 3b6c0e82f18a6359a2aba9a89b797428f23400ab && ./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testEncodingAndDecodingSamples tests/acceptance/Swift/Mime/ContentEncoder/Base64ContentEncoderAcceptanceTest.php`
PASSES.

Ok, I've addressed all of the coding style issues and removed PHPUnit from composer.

Also, might I suggest that you add a CONTRIB.md file or something similar? Before submitting the patch I looked in the repo for a "dev best practices" file and on the website as well and there's just no info about how to contribute appropriately.

I'll also add that the tests don't pass on master... so the CI builds of this branch won't pass, either.

I re-wrote my comments about the new approach and I think it's all ready to go.
