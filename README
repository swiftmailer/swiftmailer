Swift Mailer, by Chris Corbyn
-----------------------------

Swift Mailer is a component based mailing solution for PHP 5.


FOR THE IMPATIENT, WAITING FOR VERSION 4.0.0:
---------------------------------------------

At the time of writing (16th December 2008), the code is not yet ready for a
full-release.   However, it is extremely close to becoming version 4.0.0.

You can probably use the code now if you are developing an application you
do not expect to release until early 2009, or if you simply wish to play
around.  However, there is no documentation as yet so you'll have to use your
intuition and read the doc comments in the code.  To give you a head start
here's a complex example showing how to send an email to three recipients,
with an alternative body, two attachments and an embedded image, over SMTP
with a username and password.

<?php

require_once 'swift/lib/swift_required.php';

$smtp = Swift_SmtpTransport::newInstance('smtp.host.tld', 25)
  ->setUsername(' ... ')
  ->setPassword(' ... ');

$mailer = Swift_Mailer::newInstance($smtp);

$message = Swift_Message::newInstance('Your subject');
$message
  ->setTo(array(
    'user1@example.org',
    'user2@example.org' => 'User Two',
    'user3@exmaple.org' => 'Another User Name'
  ))
  ->setFrom(array('your@address.com' => 'Your Name'))
  ->attach(Swift_Attachment::fromPath('/path/to/doc1.pdf'))
  ->attach(Swift_Attachment::fromPath('/path/to/doc2.pdf'))
  ->setBody(
    'Here is an image <img src="' . $message->embed(Swift_Image::fromPath('/path/to/image.jpg')) . '" />',
    'text/html'
  )
  ->addPart('This is the alternative part', 'text/plain')
  ;

if ($mailer->send($message))
{
  echo "Message sent!";
}
else
{
  echo "Message could not be sent.";
}
