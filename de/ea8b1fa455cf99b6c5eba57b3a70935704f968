Why can't we allow `^3.0`?

@GrahamCampbell because the `MessageIDValidation` class was introduced in v3.1

Seems better to allow a wider version range, given all the 2.x versions are allowed, also.

@GrahamCampbell I don't see the need for it.

Ah, I see. 3.0.0 is actually broken. In which case, üëç for this PR, as is.
