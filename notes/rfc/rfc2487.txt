1. Abstract

	 This document describes an extension to the SMTP service that allows
	 an SMTP server and client to use transport-layer security to provide
	 private, authenticated communication over the Internet. This gives
	 SMTP agents the ability to protect some or all of their
	 communications from eavesdroppers and attackers.

2. Introduction

	 SMTP [RFC-821] servers and clients normally communicate in the clear
	 over the Internet. In many cases, this communication goes through one
	 or more router that is not controlled or trusted by either entity.
	 Such an untrusted router might allow a third party to monitor or
	 alter the communications between the server and client.

	 Further, there is often a desire for two SMTP agents to be able to
	 authenticate each others' identities. For example, a secure SMTP
	 server might only allow communications from other SMTP agents it
	 knows, or it might act differently for messages received from an
	 agent it knows than from one it doesn't know.

	 TLS [TLS], more commonly known as SSL, is a popular mechanism for
	 enhancing TCP communications with privacy and authentication. TLS is
	 in wide use with the HTTP protocol, and is also being used for adding
	 security to many other common protocols that run over TCP.

2.1 Terminology

	 The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	 "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	 document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

3. STARTTLS Extension

	 The STARTTLS extension to SMTP is laid out as follows:

	 (1) the name of the SMTP service defined here is STARTTLS;

	 (2) the EHLO keyword value associated with the extension is STARTTLS;

	 (3) the STARTTLS keyword has no parameters;

	 (4) a new SMTP verb, "STARTTLS", is defined;

	 (5) no additional parameters are added to any SMTP command.

4. The STARTTLS Keyword

	 The STARTTLS keyword is used to tell the SMTP client that the SMTP
	 server allows use of TLS. It takes no parameters.

5. The STARTTLS Command

	 The format for the STARTTLS command is:

	 STARTTLS

	 with no parameters.

	 After the client gives the STARTTLS command, the server responds with
	 one of the following reply codes:

	 220 Ready to start TLS
	 501 Syntax error (no parameters allowed)
	 454 TLS not available due to temporary reason

	 A publicly-referenced SMTP server MUST NOT require use of the
	 STARTTLS extension in order to deliver mail locally. This rule
	 prevents the STARTTLS extension from damaging the interoperability of
	 the Internet's SMTP infrastructure. A publicly-referenced SMTP server
	 is an SMTP server which runs on port 25 of an Internet host listed in
	 the MX record (or A record if an MX record is not present) for the
	 domain name on the right hand side of an Internet mail address.

RFC 2487								 SMTP Service Extension						 January 1999


	 Any SMTP server may refuse to accept messages for relay based on
	 authentication supplied during the TLS negotiation. An SMTP server
	 that is not publicly referenced may refuse to accept any messages for
	 relay or local delivery based on authentication supplied during the
	 TLS negotiation.

	 A SMTP server that is not publicly referenced may choose to require
	 that the client perform a TLS negotiation before accepting any
	 commands. In this case, the server SHOULD return the reply code:

	 530 Must issue a STARTTLS command first

	 to every command other than NOOP, EHLO, STARTTLS, or QUIT. If the
	 client and server are using the ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES ESMTP extension
	 [RFC-2034], the status code to be returned SHOULD be 5.7.0.

	 After receiving a 220 response to a STARTTLS command, the client
	 SHOULD start the TLS negotiation before giving any other SMTP
	 commands.

	 If the SMTP client is using pipelining as defined in RFC 1854, the
	 STARTTLS command must be the last command in a group.

5.1 Processing After the STARTTLS Command

	 After the TLS handshake has been completed, both parties MUST
	 immediately decide whether or not to continue based on the
	 authentication and privacy achieved. The SMTP client and server may
	 decide to move ahead even if the TLS negotiation ended with no
	 authentication and/or no privacy because most SMTP services are
	 performed with no authentication and no privacy, but some SMTP
	 clients or servers may want to continue only if a particular level of
	 authentication and/or privacy was achieved.

	 If the SMTP client decides that the level of authentication or
	 privacy is not high enough for it to continue, it SHOULD issue an
	 SMTP QUIT command immediately after the TLS negotiation is complete.
	 If the SMTP server decides that the level of authentication or
	 privacy is not high enough for it to continue, it SHOULD reply to
	 every SMTP command from the client (other than a QUIT command) with
	 the 554 reply code (with a possible text string such as "Command
	 refused due to lack of security").

	 The decision of whether or not to believe the authenticity of the
	 other party in a TLS negotiation is a local matter. However, some
	 general rules for the decisions are:





Hoffman										 Standards Track										 [Page 3]

RFC 2487								 SMTP Service Extension						 January 1999


		- A SMTP client would probably only want to authenticate an SMTP
			server whose server certificate has a domain name that is the
			domain name that the client thought it was connecting to.
		- A publicly-referenced	SMTP server would probably want to accept
			any certificate from an SMTP client, and would possibly want to
			put distinguishing information about the certificate in the
			Received header of messages that were relayed or submitted from
			the client.

5.2 Result of the STARTTLS Command

	 Upon completion of the TLS handshake, the SMTP protocol is reset to
	 the initial state (the state in SMTP after a server issues a 220
	 service ready greeting). The server MUST discard any knowledge
	 obtained from the client, such as the argument to the EHLO command,
	 which was not obtained from the TLS negotiation itself. The client
	 MUST discard any knowledge obtained from the server, such as the list
	 of SMTP service extensions, which was not obtained from the TLS
	 negotiation itself. The client SHOULD send an EHLO command as the
	 first command after a successful TLS negotiation.

	 The list of SMTP service extensions returned in response to an EHLO
	 command received after the TLS handshake MAY be different than the
	 list returned before the TLS handshake. For example, an SMTP server
	 might not want to advertise support for a particular SASL mechanism
	 [SASL] unless a client has sent an appropriate client certificate
	 during a TLS handshake.

	 Both the client and the server MUST know if there is a TLS session
	 active.	A client MUST NOT attempt to start a TLS session if a TLS
	 session is already active. A server MUST NOT return the TLS extension
	 in response to an EHLO command received after a TLS handshake has
	 completed.

6. Usage Example

	 The following dialog illustrates how a client and server can start a
	 TLS session:

	 S: <waits for connection on TCP port 25>
	 C: <opens connection>
	 S: 220 mail.imc.org SMTP service ready
	 C: EHLO mail.ietf.org
	 S: 250-mail.imc.org offers a warm hug of welcome
	 S: 250 STARTTLS
	 C: STARTTLS
	 S: 220 Go ahead
	 C: <starts TLS negotiation>



Hoffman										 Standards Track										 [Page 4]

	 C & S: <negotiate a TLS session>
	 C & S: <check result of negotiation>
	 C: <continues by sending an SMTP command>
	 . . .

7. Security Considerations

	 It should be noted that SMTP is not an end-to-end mechanism. Thus, if
	 an SMTP client/server pair decide to add TLS privacy, they are not
	 securing the transport from the originating mail user agent to the
	 recipient.	Further, because delivery of a single piece of mail may
	 go between more than two SMTP servers, adding TLS privacy to one pair
	 of servers does not mean that the entire SMTP chain has been made
	 private. Further, just because an SMTP server can authenticate an
	 SMTP client, it does not mean that the mail from the SMTP client was
	 authenticated by the SMTP client when the client received it.

	 Both the STMP client and server must check the result of the TLS
	 negotiation to see whether acceptable authentication or privacy was
	 achieved. Ignoring this step completely invalidates using TLS for
	 security.	The decision about whether acceptable authentication or
	 privacy was achieved is made locally, is implementation-dependant,
	 and is beyond the scope of this document.

	 The SMTP client and server should note carefully the result of the
	 TLS negotiation. If the negotiation results in no privacy, or if it
	 results in privacy using algorithms or key lengths that are deemed
	 not strong enough, or if the authentication is not good enough for
	 either party, the client may choose to end the SMTP session with an
	 immediate QUIT command, or the server may choose to not accept any
	 more SMTP commands.

	 A server announcing in an EHLO response that it uses a particular TLS
	 protocol should not pose any security issues, since any use of TLS
	 will be at least as secure as no use of TLS.

	 A man-in-the-middle attack can be launched by deleting the "250
	 STARTTLS" response from the server. This would cause the client not
	 to try to start a TLS session. An SMTP client can protect against
	 this attack by recording the fact that a particular SMTP server
	 offers TLS during one session and generating an alarm if it does not
	 appear in the EHLO response for a later session. The lack of TLS
	 during a session SHOULD NOT result in the bouncing of email, although
	 it could result in delayed processing.







Hoffman										 Standards Track										 [Page 5]

RFC 2487								 SMTP Service Extension						 January 1999


	 Before the TLS handshake has begun, any protocol interactions are
	 performed in the clear and may be modified by an active attacker. For
	 this reason, clients and servers MUST discard any knowledge obtained
	 prior to the start of the TLS handshake upon completion of the TLS
	 handshake.

	 The STARTTLS extension is not suitable for authenticating the author
	 of an email message unless every hop in the delivery chain, including
	 the submission to the first SMTP server, is authenticated. Another
	 proposal [SMTP-AUTH] can be used to authenticate delivery and MIME
	 security multiparts [MIME-SEC] can be used to authenticate the author
	 of an email message. In addition, the [SMTP-AUTH] proposal offers
	 simpler and more flexible options to authenticate an SMTP client and
	 the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism [SASL] MAY be used in conjunction with
	 the STARTTLS command to provide an authorization identity.
