1.	Abstract

	 This memo defines extensions to the RFC 2045 media type and RFC 2183
	 disposition parameter value mechanisms to provide

		(1)	 a means to specify parameter values in character sets
					other than US-ASCII,

		(2)	 to specify the language to be used should the value be
					displayed, and

		(3)	 a continuation mechanism for long parameter values to
					avoid problems with header line wrapping.

	 This memo also defines an extension to the encoded words defined in
	 RFC 2047 to allow the specification of the language to be used for
	 display as well as the character set.

2.	Introduction

	 The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME [RFC-2045, RFC-
	 2046, RFC-2047, RFC-2048, RFC-2049], define a message format that
	 allows for:

RFC 2231				 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions		November 1997


		(1)	 textual message bodies in character sets other than
					US-ASCII,

		(2)	 non-textual message bodies,

		(3)	 multi-part message bodies, and

		(4)	 textual header information in character sets other than
					US-ASCII.

	 MIME is now widely deployed and is used by a variety of Internet
	 protocols, including, of course, Internet email.	However, MIME's
	 success has resulted in the need for additional mechanisms that were
	 not provided in the original protocol specification.

	 In particular, existing MIME mechanisms provide for named media type
	 (content-type field) parameters as well as named disposition
	 (content-disposition field).	A MIME media type may specify any
	 number of parameters associated with all of its subtypes, and any
	 specific subtype may specify additional parameters for its own use. A
	 MIME disposition value may specify any number of associated
	 parameters, the most important of which is probably the attachment
	 disposition's filename parameter.

	 These parameter names and values end up appearing in the content-type
	 and content-disposition header fields in Internet email.	This
	 inherently imposes three crucial limitations:

		(1)	 Lines in Internet email header fields are folded
					according to RFC 822 folding rules.	This makes long
					parameter values problematic.

		(2)	 MIME headers, like the RFC 822 headers they often
					appear in, are limited to 7bit US-ASCII, and the
					encoded-word mechanisms of RFC 2047 are not available
					to parameter values.	This makes it impossible to have
					parameter values in character sets other than US-ASCII
					without specifying some sort of private per-parameter
					encoding.

		(3)	 It has recently become clear that character set
					information is not sufficient to properly display some
					sorts of information -- language information is also
					needed [RFC-2130].	For example, support for
					handicapped users may require reading text string

					aloud. The language the text is written in is needed
					for this to be done correctly.	Some parameter values
					may need to be displayed, hence there is a need to
					allow for the inclusion of language information.

	 The last problem on this list is also an issue for the encoded words
	 defined by RFC 2047, as encoded words are intended primarily for
	 display purposes.

	 This document defines extensions that address all of these
	 limitations. All of these extensions are implemented in a fashion
	 that is completely compatible at a syntactic level with existing MIME
	 implementations. In addition, the extensions are designed to have as
	 little impact as possible on existing uses of MIME.

	 IMPORTANT NOTE:	These mechanisms end up being somewhat gibbous when
	 they actually are used. As such, these mechanisms should not be used
	 lightly; they should be reserved for situations where a real need for
	 them exists.

2.1.	Requirements notation

	 This document occasionally uses terms that appear in capital letters.
	 When the terms "MUST", "SHOULD", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
	 appear capitalized, they are being used to indicate particular
	 requirements of this specification. A discussion of the meanings of
	 these terms appears in [RFC- 2119].

3.	Parameter Value Continuations

	 Long MIME media type or disposition parameter values do not interact
	 well with header line wrapping conventions.	In particular, proper
	 header line wrapping depends on there being places where linear
	 whitespace (LWSP) is allowed, which may or may not be present in a
	 parameter value, and even if present may not be recognizable as such
	 since specific knowledge of parameter value syntax may not be
	 available to the agent doing the line wrapping. The result is that
	 long parameter values may end up getting truncated or otherwise
	 damaged by incorrect line wrapping implementations.

	 A mechanism is therefore needed to break up parameter values into
	 smaller units that are amenable to line wrapping. Any such mechanism
	 MUST be compatible with existing MIME processors. This means that

		(1)	 the mechanism MUST NOT change the syntax of MIME media
					type and disposition lines, and





Freed & Moore							 Standards Track										 [Page 3]

RFC 2231				 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions		November 1997


		(2)	 the mechanism MUST NOT depend on parameter ordering
					since MIME states that parameters are not order
					sensitive.	Note that while MIME does prohibit
					modification of MIME headers during transport, it is
					still possible that parameters will be reordered when
					user agent level processing is done.

	 The obvious solution, then, is to use multiple parameters to contain
	 a single parameter value and to use some kind of distinguished name
	 to indicate when this is being done.	And this obvious solution is
	 exactly what is specified here: The asterisk character ("*") followed
	 by a decimal count is employed to indicate that multiple parameters
	 are being used to encapsulate a single parameter value.	The count
	 starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each subsequent section of the
	 parameter value.	Decimal values are used and neither leading zeroes
	 nor gaps in the sequence are allowed.

	 The original parameter value is recovered by concatenating the
	 various sections of the parameter, in order.	For example, the
	 content-type field

				Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type=URL;
				 URL*0="ftp://";
				 URL*1="cs.utk.edu/pub/moore/bulk-mailer/bulk-mailer.tar"

	 is semantically identical to

				Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type=URL;
					URL="ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/moore/bulk-mailer/bulk-mailer.tar"

	 Note that quotes around parameter values are part of the value
	 syntax; they are NOT part of the value itself.	Furthermore, it is
	 explicitly permitted to have a mixture of quoted and unquoted
	 continuation fields.

4.	Parameter Value Character Set and Language Information

	 Some parameter values may need to be qualified with character set or
	 language information.	It is clear that a distinguished parameter
	 name is needed to identify when this information is present along
	 with a specific syntax for the information in the value itself.	In
	 addition, a lightweight encoding mechanism is needed to accommodate 8
	 bit information in parameter values.








Freed & Moore							 Standards Track										 [Page 4]

RFC 2231				 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions		November 1997


	 Asterisks ("*") are reused to provide the indicator that language and
	 character set information is present and encoding is being used. A
	 single quote ("'") is used to delimit the character set and language
	 information at the beginning of the parameter value. Percent signs
	 ("%") are used as the encoding flag, which agrees with RFC 2047.

	 Specifically, an asterisk at the end of a parameter name acts as an
	 indicator that character set and language information may appear at
	 the beginning of the parameter value. A single quote is used to
	 separate the character set, language, and actual value information in
	 the parameter value string, and an percent sign is used to flag
	 octets encoded in hexadecimal.	For example:

				Content-Type: application/x-stuff;
				 title*=us-ascii'en-us'This%20is%20%2A%2A%2Afun%2A%2A%2A

	 Note that it is perfectly permissible to leave either the character
	 set or language field blank.	Note also that the single quote
	 delimiters MUST be present even when one of the field values is
	 omitted.	This is done when either character set, language, or both
	 are not relevant to the parameter value at hand.	This MUST NOT be
	 done in order to indicate a default character set or language --
	 parameter field definitions MUST NOT assign a default character set
	 or language.

4.1.	Combining Character Set, Language, and Parameter Continuations

	 Character set and language information may be combined with the
	 parameter continuation mechanism. For example:

	 Content-Type: application/x-stuff
		title*0*=us-ascii'en'This%20is%20even%20more%20
		title*1*=%2A%2A%2Afun%2A%2A%2A%20
		title*2="isn't it!"

	 Note that:

		(1)	 Language and character set information only appear at
					the beginning of a given parameter value.

		(2)	 Continuations do not provide a facility for using more
					than one character set or language in the same
					parameter value.

		(3)	 A value presented using multiple continuations may
					contain a mixture of encoded and unencoded segments.





Freed & Moore							 Standards Track										 [Page 5]

RFC 2231				 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions		November 1997


		(4)	 The first segment of a continuation MUST be encoded if
					language and character set information are given.

		(5)	 If the first segment of a continued parameter value is
					encoded the language and character set field delimiters
					MUST be present even when the fields are left blank.

5.	Language specification in Encoded Words

	 RFC 2047 provides support for non-US-ASCII character sets in RFC 822
	 message header comments, phrases, and any unstructured text field.
	 This is done by defining an encoded word construct which can appear
	 in any of these places.	Given that these are fields intended for
	 display, it is sometimes necessary to associate language information
	 with encoded words as well as just the character set.	This
	 specification extends the definition of an encoded word to allow the
	 inclusion of such information.	This is simply done by suffixing the
	 character set specification with an asterisk followed by the language
	 tag.	For example:

					From: =?US-ASCII*EN?Q?Keith_Moore?= <moore@cs.utk.edu>

6.	IMAP4 Handling of Parameter Values

	 IMAP4 [RFC-2060] servers SHOULD decode parameter value continuations
	 when generating the BODY and BODYSTRUCTURE fetch attributes.

7.	Modifications to MIME ABNF

	 The ABNF for MIME parameter values given in RFC 2045 is:

	 parameter := attribute "=" value

	 attribute := token
								; Matching of attributes
								; is ALWAYS case-insensitive.

	 This specification changes this ABNF to:

	 parameter := regular-parameter / extended-parameter

	 regular-parameter := regular-parameter-name "=" value

	 regular-parameter-name := attribute [section]

	 attribute := 1*attribute-char





Freed & Moore							 Standards Track										 [Page 6]

RFC 2231				 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions		November 1997


	 attribute-char := <any (US-ASCII) CHAR except SPACE, CTLs,
										 "*", "'", "%", or tspecials>

	 section := initial-section / other-sections

	 initial-section := "*0"

	 other-sections := "*" ("1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" /
													"6" / "7" / "8" / "9") *DIGIT)

	 extended-parameter := (extended-initial-name "="
													extended-value) /
												 (extended-other-names "="
													extended-other-values)

	 extended-initial-name := attribute [initial-section] "*"

	 extended-other-names := attribute other-sections "*"

	 extended-initial-value := [charset] "'" [language] "'"
														 extended-other-values

	 extended-other-values := *(ext-octet / attribute-char)

	 ext-octet := "%" 2(DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F")

	 charset := <registered character set name>

	 language := <registered language tag [RFC-1766]>

	 The ABNF given in RFC 2047 for encoded-words is:

	 encoded-word := "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" encoded-text "?="

	 This specification changes this ABNF to:

	 encoded-word := "=?" charset ["*" language] "?" encoded-text "?="

8.	Character sets which allow specification of language

	 In the future it is likely that some character sets will provide
	 facilities for inline language labeling. Such facilities are
	 inherently more flexible than those defined here as they allow for
	 language switching in the middle of a string.







Freed & Moore							 Standards Track										 [Page 7]

RFC 2231				 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions		November 1997


	 If and when such facilities are developed they SHOULD be used in
	 preference to the language labeling facilities specified here. Note
	 that all the mechanisms defined here allow for the omission of
	 language labels so as to be able to accommodate this possible future
	 usage.

9.	Security Considerations

	 This RFC does not discuss security issues and is not believed to
	 raise any security issues not already endemic in electronic mail and
	 present in fully conforming implementations of MIME.
