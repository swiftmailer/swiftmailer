	Anonymous Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism

Status of This Memo

	 This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
	 Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
	 improvements.	Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
	 Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
	 and status of this protocol.	Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

	 On the Internet, it is common practice to permit anonymous access to
	 various services.	Traditionally, this has been done with a plain-
	 text password mechanism using "anonymous" as the user name and using
	 optional trace information, such as an email address, as the
	 password.	As plain-text login commands are not permitted in new IETF
	 protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the
	 context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
	 framework.

1.	Introduction

	 This document defines an anonymous mechanism for the Simple
	 Authentication and Security Layer ([SASL]) framework.	The name
	 associated with this mechanism is "ANONYMOUS".

	 Unlike many other SASL mechanisms, whose purpose is to authenticate
	 and identify the user to a server, the purpose of this SASL mechanism
	 is to allow the user to gain access to services or resources without
	 requiring the user to establish or otherwise disclose their identity
	 to the server.	That is, this mechanism provides an anonymous login
	 method.

	 This mechanism does not provide a security layer.

	 This document replaces RFC 2245.	Changes since RFC 2245 are detailed
	 in Appendix A.

2.	The Anonymous Mechanism

	 The mechanism consists of a single message from the client to the
	 server.	The client may include in this message trace information in
	 the form of a string of [UTF-8]-encoded [Unicode] characters prepared
	 in accordance with [StringPrep] and the "trace" stringprep profile
	 defined in Section 3 of this document.	The trace information, which
	 has no semantical value, should take one of two forms: an Internet
	 email address, or an opaque string that does not contain the '@'
	 (U+0040) character and that can be interpreted by the system
	 administrator of the client's domain.	For privacy reasons, an
	 Internet email address or other information identifying the user
	 should only be used with permission from the user.

	 A server that permits anonymous access will announce support for the
	 ANONYMOUS mechanism and allow anyone to log in using that mechanism,
	 usually with restricted access.

	 A formal grammar for the client message using Augmented BNF [ABNF] is
	 provided below as a tool for understanding this technical
	 specification.

			message		 = [ email / token ]
										;; to be prepared in accordance with Section 3

			UTF1				= %x00-3F / %x41-7F ;; less '@' (U+0040)
			UTF2				= %xC2-DF UTF0
			UTF3				= %xE0 %xA0-BF UTF0 / %xE1-EC 2(UTF0) /
										%xED %x80-9F UTF0 / %xEE-EF 2(UTF0)
			UTF4				= %xF0 %x90-BF 2(UTF0) / %xF1-F3 3(UTF0) /
										%xF4 %x80-8F 2(UTF0)
			UTF0				= %x80-BF

			TCHAR			 = UTF1 / UTF2 / UTF3 / UTF4
										;; any UTF-8 encoded Unicode character
										;; except '@' (U+0040)

			email			 = addr-spec
										;; as defined in [IMAIL]

			token			 = 1*255TCHAR

	 Note to implementors:
			The <token> production is restricted to 255 UTF-8-encoded Unicode
			characters.	As the encoding of a characters uses a sequence of 1
			to 4 octets, a token may be as long as 1020 octets.

3.	The "trace" Profile of "Stringprep"

	 This section defines the "trace" profile of [StringPrep].	This
	 profile is designed for use with the SASL ANONYMOUS Mechanism.
	 Specifically, the client is to prepare the <message> production in
	 accordance with this profile.

	 The character repertoire of this profile is Unicode 3.2 [Unicode].

	 No mapping is required by this profile.

	 No Unicode normalization is required by this profile.

	 The list of unassigned code points for this profile is that provided
	 in Appendix A of [StringPrep].	Unassigned code points are not
	 prohibited.

	 Characters from the following tables of [StringPrep] are prohibited:

			- C.2.1 (ASCII control characters)
			- C.2.2 (Non-ASCII control characters)
			- C.3 (Private use characters)
			- C.4 (Non-character code points)
			- C.5 (Surrogate codes)
			- C.6 (Inappropriate for plain text)
			- C.8 (Change display properties are deprecated)
			- C.9 (Tagging characters)

	 No additional characters are prohibited.

	 This profile requires bidirectional character checking per Section 6
	 of [StringPrep].

4.	Example

	 Here is a sample ANONYMOUS login between an IMAP client and server.
	 In this example, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
	 server, respectively.	If such lines are wrapped without a new "C:"
	 or "S:" label, then the wrapping is for editorial clarity and is not
	 part of the command.

	 Note that this example uses the IMAP profile [IMAP4] of SASL.	The
	 base64 encoding of challenges and responses as well as the "+ "
	 preceding the responses are part of the IMAP4 profile, not part of
	 SASL itself.	Additionally, protocols with SASL profiles permitting
	 an initial client response will be able to avoid the extra round trip
	 below (the server response with an empty "+ ").

	 In this example, the trace information is "sirhc".

			S: * OK IMAP4 server ready
			C: A001 CAPABILITY
			S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 AUTH=ANONYMOUS
			S: A001 OK done
			C: A002 AUTHENTICATE ANONYMOUS
			S: +
			C: c2lyaGM=
			S: A003 OK Welcome, trace information has been logged.

5.	Security Considerations

	 The ANONYMOUS mechanism grants access to services and/or resources by
	 anyone.	For this reason, it should be disabled by default so that
	 the administrator can make an explicit decision to enable it.

	 If the anonymous user has any write privileges, a denial-of-service
	 attack is possible by filling up all available space.	This can be
	 prevented by disabling all write access by anonymous users.

	 If anonymous users have read and write access to the same area, the
	 server can be used as a communication mechanism to exchange
	 information anonymously.	Servers that accept anonymous submissions
	 should implement the common "drop box" model, which forbids anonymous
	 read access to the area where anonymous submissions are accepted.

	 If the anonymous user can run many expensive operations (e.g., an
	 IMAP SEARCH BODY command), this could enable a denial-of-service
	 attack.	Servers are encouraged to reduce the priority of anonymous
	 users or limit their resource usage.

	 While servers may impose a limit on the number of anonymous users,
	 note that such limits enable denial-of-service attacks and should be
	 used with caution.

	 The trace information is not authenticated, so it can be falsified.
	 This can be used as an attempt to get someone else in trouble for
	 access to questionable information.	Administrators investigating
	 abuse need to realize that this trace information may be falsified.

	 A client that uses the user's correct email address as trace
	 information without explicit permission may violate that user's
	 privacy.	Anyone who accesses an anonymous archive on a sensitive
	 subject (e.g., sexual abuse) likely has strong privacy needs.
	 Clients should not send the email address without the explicit
	 permission of the user and should offer the option of supplying no
	 trace information, thus only exposing the source IP address and time.

RFC 4505								Anonymous SASL Mechanism							 June 2006


	 Anonymous proxy servers could enhance this privacy but would have to
	 consider the resulting potential denial-of-service attacks.

	 Anonymous connections are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks
	 that view or alter the data transferred.	Clients and servers are
	 encouraged to support external data security services.

	 Protocols that fail to require an explicit anonymous login are more
	 susceptible to break-ins given certain common implementation
	 techniques.	Specifically, Unix servers that offer user login may
	 initially start up as root and switch to the appropriate user id
	 after an explicit login command.	Normally, such servers refuse all
	 data access commands prior to explicit login and may enter a
	 restricted security environment (e.g., the Unix chroot(2) function)
	 for anonymous users.	If anonymous access is not explicitly
	 requested, the entire data access machinery is exposed to external
	 security attacks without the chance for explicit protective measures.
	 Protocols that offer restricted data access should not allow
	 anonymous data access without an explicit login step.

	 General [SASL] security considerations apply to this mechanism.

	 [StringPrep] security considerations and [Unicode] security
	 considerations discussed in [StringPrep] apply to this mechanism.
	 [UTF-8] security considerations also apply.

	 mechanism has been updated by the IANA to reflect that this document
	 now provides its technical specification.

Appendix A.	Changes since RFC 2245

	 This appendix is non-normative.

	 RFC 2245 allows the client to include optional trace information in
	 the form of a human readable string.	RFC 2245 restricted this string
	 to US-ASCII.	As the Internet is international, this document uses a
	 string restricted to UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters.	A
	 "stringprep" profile is defined to precisely define which Unicode
	 characters are allowed in this string.	While the string remains
	 restricted to 255 characters, the encoded length of each character
	 may now range from 1 to 4 octets.

	 Additionally, a number of editorial changes were made.
