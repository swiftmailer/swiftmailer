Abstract

	 This specification establishes two parameters (Format and DelSP) to
	 be used with the Text/Plain media type.	In the presence of these
	 parameters, trailing whitespace is used to indicate flowed lines and
	 a canonical quote indicator is used to indicate quoted lines.	This
	 results in an encoding which appears as normal Text/Plain in older
	 implementations, since it is in fact normal Text/Plain, yet provides
	 for superior wrapping/flowing, and quoting.

	 This document supersedes the one specified in RFC 2646, "The
	 Text/Plain Format Parameter", and adds the DelSp parameter to
	 accommodate languages/coded character sets in which ASCII spaces are
	 not used or appear rarely.

1.	Introduction

	 Interoperability problems have been observed with erroneous labelling
	 of paragraph text as Text/Plain, and with various forms of
	 "embarrassing line wrap".	(See Section 3.)

	 Attempts to deploy new media types, such as Text/Enriched [Rich] and
	 Text/HTML [HTML] have suffered from a lack of backwards compatibility
	 and an often hostile user reaction at the receiving end.

	 What is required is a format which is in all significant ways
	 Text/Plain, and therefore is quite suitable for display as
	 Text/Plain, and yet allows the sender to express to the receiver
	 which lines are quoted and which lines are considered a logical
	 paragraph, and thus eligible to be flowed (wrapped and joined) as
	 appropriate.

2.	Conventions Used in this Document

	 The key words "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
	 and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in "Key
	 words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].

	 The term "paragraph" is used here to mean a series of lines which are
	 logically to be treated as a unit for display purposes and eligible
	 to be flowed (wrapped and joined) as appropriate to fit in the
	 display window and when creating text for replies, forwarding, etc.

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


3.	The Problem

	 The Text/Plain media type is the lowest common denominator of
	 Internet email, with lines of no more than 998 characters (by
	 convention usually no more than 78), and where the carriage-return
	 and line-feed (CRLF) sequence represents a line break (see [MIME-IMT]
	 and [MSG-FMT]).

	 Text/Plain is usually displayed as preformatted text, often in a
	 fixed font.	That is, the characters start at the left margin of the
	 display window, and advance to the right until a CRLF sequence is
	 seen, at which point a new line is started, again at the left margin.
	 When a line length exceeds the display window, some clients will wrap
	 the line, while others invoke a horizontal scroll bar.

	 Text which meets this description is defined by this memo as "fixed".

	 Some interoperability problems have been observed with this format:

3.1.	Paragraph Text

	 Many modern programs use a proportional-spaced font, and use CRLF to
	 represent paragraph breaks.	Line breaks are "soft", occurring as
	 needed on display.	That is, characters are grouped into a paragraph
	 until a CRLF sequence is seen, at which point a new paragraph is
	 started.	Each paragraph is displayed, starting at the left margin
	 (or paragraph indent), and continuing to the right until a word is
	 encountered which does not fit in the remaining display width.	This
	 word is displayed at the left margin of the next line.	This
	 continues until the paragraph ends (a CRLF is seen).	Extra vertical
	 space is left between paragraphs.

	 Text which meets this description is defined by this memo as
	 "flowed".

	 Numerous software products erroneously label this format as
	 Text/Plain, resulting in much user discomfort.

3.2.	Embarrassing Line Wrap

	 As Text/Plain messages are quoted in replies or forwarded messages,
	 each line gradually increases in length, eventually being arbitrarily
	 hard wrapped, resulting in "embarrassing line wrap".	This produces
	 text which is, at best, hard to read, and often confuses
	 attributions.






Gellens										 Standards Track										 [Page 3]

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


	 Example:

			>>>>>>This is a comment from the first message to show a
			>quoting example.
			>>>>>This is a comment from the second message to show a
			>quoting example.
			>>>>This is a comment from the third message.
			>>>This is a comment from the fourth message.

	 It can be confusing to assign attribution to lines 2 and 4 above.

	 In addition, as devices with display widths smaller than 79 or 80
	 characters become more popular, embarrassing line wrap has become
	 even more prevalent, even with unquoted text.

	 Example:

			This is paragraph text that is
			meant to be flowed across
			several lines.
			However, the sending mailer is
			converting it to fixed text at
			a width of 72
			characters, which causes it to
			look like this when shown on a
			PDA with only
			30 character lines.

3.3.	New Media Types

	 Attempts to deploy new media types, such as Text/Enriched [Rich] and
	 Text/HTML [HTML] have suffered from a lack of backwards compatibility
	 and an often hostile user reaction at the receiving end.

	 In particular, Text/Enriched requires that open angle brackets ("<")
	 and hard line breaks be doubled, with resulting user unhappiness when
	 viewed as Text/Plain.	Text/HTML requires even more alteration of
	 text, with a corresponding increase in user complaints.

	 A proposal to define a new media type to explicitly represent the
	 paragraph form suffered from a lack of interoperability with
	 currently deployed software.	Some programs treat unknown subtypes of
	 TEXT as an attachment.








Gellens										 Standards Track										 [Page 4]

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


	 What is desired is a format which is in all significant ways
	 Text/Plain, and therefore is quite suitable for display as
	 Text/Plain, and yet allows the sender to express to the receiver
	 which lines can be considered a logical paragraph, and thus flowed
	 (wrapped and joined) as appropriate.

4.	The Format and DelSp Parameters

	 This specification defines two MIME parameters for use with
	 Text/Plain:

			Name:	Format
			Value:	Fixed, Flowed

			Name:	DelSp
			Value:	Yes, No

	 (Neither the parameter names nor values are case sensitive.)

	 If Format is not specified, or if the value is not recognized, a
	 value of Fixed is assumed.	The semantics of the Fixed value are the
	 usual associated with Text/Plain [MIME-IMT].

	 A Format value of Flowed indicates that the definition of flowed text
	 (as specified in this memo) was used on generation, and MAY be used
	 on reception.

	 Note that because Format is a parameter of the Text/Plain content-
	 type, any content-transfer-encoding used is irrelevant to the
	 processing of flowed text.

	 If DelSp is not specified, or if its value is not recognized, a value
	 of No is assumed.	The use of DelSp without a Format value of Flowed
	 is undefined.	When creating messages, DelSp SHOULD NOT be specified
	 in Text content types other than Text/Plain with Format = Flowed.
	 When receiving messages, DelSp SHOULD be ignored if used in a Text
	 content type other than Text/Plain with Format = Flowed.

	 This section discusses flowed text; section 6 provides a formal
	 definition.

	 Section 5 discusses interoperability.

	 Note that this memo describes an on-the-wire format.	It does not
	 address formats for local file storage.

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


4.1.	Interpreting Format=Flowed

	 If the first character of a line is a quote mark (">"), the line is
	 considered to be quoted (see Section 4.5).	Logically, all quote
	 marks are counted and deleted, resulting in a line with a non-zero
	 quote depth, and content.	(The agent is of course free to display
	 the content with quote marks or excerpt bars or anything else.)
	 Logically, this test for quoted lines is done before any other tests
	 (that is, before checking for space-stuffed and flowed).

	 If the first character of a line is a space, the line has been
	 space-stuffed (see Section 4.4).	Logically, this leading space is
	 deleted before examining the line further (that is, before checking
	 for flowed).

	 If the line ends in a space, the line is flowed.	Otherwise it is
	 fixed.	The exception to this rule is a signature separator line,
	 described in Section 4.3.	Such lines end in a space but are neither
	 flowed nor fixed.

	 If the line is flowed and DelSp is "yes", the trailing space
	 immediately prior to the line's CRLF is logically deleted.	If the
	 DelSp parameter is "no" (or not specified, or set to an unrecognized
	 value), the trailing space is not deleted.

	 Any remaining trailing spaces are part of the line's content, but the
	 CRLF of a soft line break is not.

	 A series of one or more flowed lines followed by one fixed line is
	 considered a paragraph, and MAY be flowed (wrapped and unwrapped) as
	 appropriate on display and in the construction of new messages (see
	 Section 4.5).

	 An interpreting agent SHOULD allow for three exceptions to the rule
	 that paragraphs end with a fixed line.	These exceptions are
	 improperly constructed messages: a flowed line SHOULD be considered
	 to end the paragraph if it is followed by a line of a different quote
	 depth (see 4.5) or by a signature separator (see 4.3); the end of the
	 body also ends the paragraph.

	 A line consisting of one or more spaces (after deleting a space
	 acting as stuffing) is considered a flowed line.

	 An empty line (just a CRLF) is a fixed line.

	 Note that, for Unicode text, [Annex-14] provides guidance for
	 choosing at which characters to wrap a line.

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


4.2.	Generating Format=Flowed

	 When generating Format=Flowed text, lines SHOULD be 78 characters or
	 shorter, including any trailing white space and also including any
	 space added as part of stuffing (see Section 4.4).	As suggested
	 values, any paragraph longer than 78 characters in total length could
	 be wrapped using lines of 72 or fewer characters.	While the specific
	 line length used is a matter of aesthetics and preference, longer
	 lines are more likely to require rewrapping and to encounter
	 difficulties with older mailers.	(It has been suggested that 66
	 character lines are the most readable.)

	 The restriction to 78 or fewer characters between CRLFs on the wire
	 is to conform to [MSG-FMT].

	 (In addition to conformance to [MSG-FMT], there is a historical need
	 that all lines, even when displayed by a non-flowed-aware program,
	 will fit in a standard 79- or 80-column screen without having to be
	 wrapped.	The limit is 78, not 79 or 80, because while 79 or 80 fit
	 on a line, the last column is often reserved for a line-wrap
	 indicator.)

	 When creating flowed text, the generating agent wraps, that is,
	 inserts 'soft' line breaks as needed.	Soft line breaks are added at
	 natural wrapping points, such as between words.	A soft line break is
	 a SP CRLF sequence.

	 There are two techniques for inserting soft line breaks.	The older
	 technique, established by RFC 2646, creates a soft line break by
	 inserting a CRLF after the occurrence of a space.	With this
	 technique, soft line breaks are only possible where spaces already
	 occur.	When this technique is used, the DelSp parameter SHOULD be
	 used; if used it MUST be set to "no".

	 The newer technique, suitable for use even with languages/coded
	 character sets in which the ASCII space character is rare or not
	 used, creates a soft line break by inserting a SP CRLF sequence.
	 When this technique is used, the DelSp parameter MUST be used and
	 MUST be set to "yes".	Note that because of space-stuffing (see
	 Section 4.4), when this technique is used and a soft line break is
	 inserted at a point where a SP already exists (such as between
	 words), if the SP CRLF sequence is added immediately before the SP,
	 the pre-existing SP becomes leading and thus requires stuffing.	It
	 is RECOMMENDED that agents avoid this by inserting the SP CRLF
	 sequence following the existing SP.

	 Generating agents MAY use either method within each Text/Plain body
	 part.



Gellens										 Standards Track										 [Page 7]

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


	 Regardless of which technique is used, a generating agent SHOULD NOT
	 insert a space in an unnatural location, such as into a word (a
	 sequence of printable characters, not containing spaces, in a
	 language/coded character set in which spaces are common).	If faced
	 with such a word which exceeds 78 characters (but less than 998
	 characters, the [SMTP] limit on line length), the agent SHOULD send
	 the word as is and exceed the 78-character limit on line length.

	 A generating agent SHOULD:

	 o	Ensure all lines (fixed and flowed) are 78 characters or fewer in
			length, counting any trailing space as well as a space added as
			stuffing, but not counting the CRLF, unless a word by itself
			exceeds 78 characters.

	 o	Trim spaces before user-inserted hard line breaks.

	 A generating agent MUST:

	 o	Space-stuff lines which start with a space, "From ", or ">".

	 In order to create messages which do not require space-stuffing, and
	 are thus more aesthetically pleasing when viewed as Format=Fixed, a
	 generating agent MAY avoid wrapping immediately before ">", "From ",
	 or space.

	 (See Sections 4.4 and 4.5 for more information on space-stuffing and
	 quoting, respectively.)

	 A Format=Flowed message consists of zero or more paragraphs, each
	 containing one or more flowed lines followed by one fixed line.	The
	 usual case is a series of flowed text lines with blank (empty) fixed
	 lines between them.

	 Any number of fixed lines can appear between paragraphs.

	 When placing soft line breaks in a paragraph, generating agents MUST
	 NOT place them in a way that causes any line of the paragraph to be a
	 signature separator line, because paragraphs cannot contain signature
	 separator lines (see Sections 4.3 and 6).

	 [Quoted-Printable] encoding SHOULD NOT be used with Format=Flowed
	 unless absolutely necessary (for example, non-US-ASCII (8-bit)
	 characters over a strictly 7-bit transport such as unextended
	 [SMTP]).	In particular, a message SHOULD NOT be encoded in Quoted-
	 Printable for the sole purpose of protecting the trailing space on
	 flowed lines unless the body part is cryptographically signed or
	 encrypted (see Section 4.6).



Gellens										 Standards Track										 [Page 8]

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


	 The intent of Format=Flowed is to allow user agents to generate
	 flowed text which is non-obnoxious when viewed as pure, raw
	 Text/Plain (without any decoding); use of Quoted-Printable hinders
	 this and may cause Format=Flowed to be rejected by end users.

4.3.	Usenet Signature Convention

	 There is a long-standing convention in Usenet news which also
	 commonly appears in Internet mail of using "-- " as the separator
	 line between the body and the signature of a message.	When
	 generating a Format=Flowed message containing a Usenet-style
	 separator before the signature, the separator line is sent as-is.
	 This is a special case; an (optionally quoted or quoted and stuffed)
	 line consisting of DASH DASH SP is neither fixed nor flowed.

	 Generating agents MUST NOT end a paragraph with such a signature
	 line.

	 A receiving agent needs to test for a signature line both before the
	 test for a quoted line (see Section 4.5) and also after logically
	 counting and deleting quote marks and stuffing (see Section 4.4) from
	 a quoted line.

4.4.	Space-Stuffing

	 In order to allow for unquoted lines which start with ">", and to
	 protect against systems which "From-munge" in-transit messages
	 (modifying any line which starts with "From " to ">From "),
	 Format=Flowed provides for space-stuffing.

	 Space-stuffing adds a single space to the start of any line which
	 needs protection when the message is generated.	On reception, if the
	 first character of a line is a space, it is logically deleted.	This
	 occurs after the test for a quoted line (which logically counts and
	 deletes any quote marks), and before the test for a flowed line.

	 On generation, any unquoted lines which start with ">", and any lines
	 which start with a space or "From " MUST be space-stuffed.	Other
	 lines MAY be space-stuffed as desired.

	 (Note that space-stuffing is conceptually similar to dot-stuffing as
	 specified in [SMTP].)

4.5.	Quoting

	 In Format=Flowed, the canonical quote indicator (or quote mark) is
	 one or more close angle bracket (">") characters.	Lines which start
	 with the quote indicator are considered quoted.	The number of ">"



Gellens										 Standards Track										 [Page 9]

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


	 characters at the start of the line specifies the quote depth.
	 Flowed lines which are also quoted may require special handling on
	 display and when copied to new messages.

	 When creating quoted flowed lines, each such line starts with the
	 quote indicator.

	 Note that because of space-stuffing, the lines
			 >> Exit, Stage Left
	 and
			 >>Exit, Stage Left
	 are semantically identical; both have a quote-depth of two, and a
	 content of "Exit, Stage Left".

	 However, the line
			 > > Exit, Stage Left
	 is different.	It has a quote-depth of one, and a content of
	 "> Exit, Stage Left".

	 When generating quoted flowed lines, an agent needs to pay attention
	 to changes in quote depth.	All lines of a paragraph MUST be
	 unquoted, or else they MUST all be quoted and have the same quote
	 depth.	Therefore, whenever there is a change in quote depth, or a
	 change from quoted to unquoted, or change from unquoted to quoted,
	 the line immediately preceding the change MUST NOT be a flowed line.

	 If a receiving agent wishes to reformat flowed quoted lines (joining
	 and/or wrapping them) on display or when generating new messages, the
	 lines SHOULD be de-quoted, reformatted, and then re-quoted.	To de-
	 quote, the number of close angle brackets in the quote indicator at
	 the start of each line is counted.	To re-quote after reformatting, a
	 quote indicator containing the same number of close angle brackets
	 originally present are prefixed to each line.

	 On reception, if a change in quote depth occurs on a flowed line,
	 this is an improperly formatted message.	The receiver SHOULD handle
	 this error by using the 'quote-depth-wins' rule, which is to consider
	 the paragraph to end with the flowed line immediately preceding the
	 change in quote depth.

	 In other words, whenever two adjacent lines have different quote
	 depths, senders MUST ensure that the earlier line is not flowed (does
	 not end in a space), and receivers finding a flowed line there SHOULD
	 treat it as the last line of a paragraph.

	 For example, consider the following sequence of lines (using '*' to
	 indicate a soft line break, i.e., SP CRLF, and '#' to indicate a hard
	 line break, i.e., CRLF):



Gellens										 Standards Track										[Page 10]

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


			> Thou villainous ill-breeding spongy dizzy-eyed*
			> reeky elf-skinned pigeon-egg!*		 <--- problem ---<
			>> Thou artless swag-bellied milk-livered*
			>> dismal-dreaming idle-headed scut!#
			>>> Thou errant folly-fallen spleeny reeling-ripe*
			>>> unmuzzled ratsbane!#
			>>>> Henceforth, the coding style is to be strictly*
			>>>> enforced, including the use of only upper case.#
			>>>>> I've noticed a lack of adherence to the coding*
			>>>>> styles, of late.#
			>>>>>> Any complaints?#

	 The second line ends in a soft line break, even though it is the last
	 line of the one-deep quote block.	The question then arises as to how
	 this line is to be interpreted, considering that the next line is the
	 first line of the two-deep quote block.

	 The example text above, when processed according to quote-depth wins,
	 results in the first two lines being considered as one quoted, flowed
	 section, with a quote depth of 1; the third and fourth lines become a
	 quoted, flowed section, with a quote depth of 2.

	 A generating agent MUST NOT create this situation; a receiving agent
	 SHOULD handle it by giving preference to the quote depth.

4.6.	Digital Signatures and Encryption

	 If a message is digitally signed or encrypted it is important that
	 cryptographic processing use the same text for signature verification
	 and/or decryption as was used for signature generation and/or
	 encryption.	Since the use of format=flowed allows text to be altered
	 (by adding or removing line breaks and trailing spaces) between
	 composition and transmission, and between reception and display,
	 interoperability problems or security vulnerabilities may arise if
	 originator and recipient do not both use the on-the-wire format for
	 cryptographic processing.

	 The implications of the interaction between format=flowed and any
	 specific cryptographic process depend on the details of the
	 cryptographic processing and should be understood before using
	 format=flowed in conjunction with signed and/or encrypted messages.

	 Note that [OpenPGP] specifies (in Section 7.1) that "any trailing
	 whitespace (spaces, and tabs, 0x09) at the end of any line is ignored
	 when the cleartext signature is calculated."






Gellens										 Standards Track										[Page 11]

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


	 Thus it would be possible to add, in transit, a format=flowed header
	 to a regular, format=fixed vanilla PGP (not [OpenPGP-MIME]) signed
	 message and add arbitrary trailing space characters without this
	 addition being detected.	This would change the rendering of the
	 article by a client which supported format=flowed.

	 Therefore, the use of [OpenPGP] with format=flowed messages is
	 strongly discouraged. [OpenPGP-MIME] is recommended instead.

4.7.	Examples

	 The following example contains three paragraphs:

			`Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very
			earnestly.

			`I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so I
			can't take more.'

			`You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very easy
			to take MORE than nothing.'

	 This could be encoded as follows (using '*' to indicate a soft line
	 break, that is, SP CRLF sequence, and '#' to indicate a hard line
	 break, that is, CRLF):

			`Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very*
			earnestly.#
			#
			`I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so*
			I can't take more.'#
			#
			`You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very*
			easy to take MORE than nothing.'#

	 To show an example of quoting, here we have the same exchange,
	 presented as a series of direct quotes:

			>>>Take some more tea.#
			>>I've had nothing yet, so I can't take more.#
			>You mean you can't take LESS, it's very easy to take*
			>MORE than nothing.#

5.	Interoperability

	 Because flowed lines are all-but-indistinguishable from fixed lines,
	 software which does not recognize Format=Flowed treats flowed lines
	 as normal Text/Plain (which is what they are).	Thus, Format=Flowed



Gellens										 Standards Track										[Page 12]

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


	 interoperates with older clients, although flowed lines will have
	 trailing white space inserted.

	 If a space-stuffed message is received by an agent which handles
	 Format=Flowed, the space-stuffing is reversed and thus the message
	 appears unchanged.	An agent which is not aware of Format=Flowed will
	 of course not undo any space-stuffing; thus Format=Flowed messages
	 may appear with a leading space on some lines (those which start with
	 a space, ">" which is not a quote indicator, or "From ").	Since
	 lines which require space-stuffing rarely occur, and the aesthetic
	 consequences of unreversed space-stuffing are minimal, this is not
	 expected to be a significant problem.

	 If some lines begin with one or more spaces, the generating agent MAY
	 space-stuff all lines, to maintain the relative indentation of the
	 lines when viewed by clients which are not aware of Format=Flowed.

	 Messages generated with DelSp=yes and received by clients which are
	 aware of Format=Flowed but are not aware of the DelSp parameter will
	 have an extra space remaining after removal of soft line breaks.
	 Thus, when generating text in languages/coded character sets in which
	 spaces are common, the generating agent MAY always use the DelSp=no
	 method.

	 Hand-aligned text, such as ASCII tables or art, source code, etc.,
	 SHOULD be sent as fixed, not flowed lines.

6.	ABNF

	 The constructs used in Text/Plain; Format=Flowed body parts are
	 described using Augmented Backus-Naur Form [ABNF], including the core
	 rules defined in Appendix A.

	 Note that the SP (space) and ">" characters are encoded according to
	 the charset parameter.

flowed-body			= *( paragraph / fixed-line / sig-sep )
paragraph				= 1*flowed-line fixed-line
									 ; all lines in paragraph MUST be unquoted or
									 ; have same quote depth
flowed-line			= ( flowed-line-qt / flowed-line-unqt ) flow CRLF
flowed-line-qt	 = quote ( ( stuffing stuffed-flowed ) /
													 unstuffed-flowed )
flowed-line-unqt = ( stuffing stuffed-flowed ) / unstuffed-flowed
stuffed-flowed	 = *text-char
unstuffed-flowed = non-sp-quote *text-char
fixed-line			 = fixed-line-qt / fixed-line-unqt
fixed-line-qt		= quote ( ( stuffing stuffed-fixed ) /

													 unstuffed-fixed ) CRLF
fixed-line-unqt	= ( stuffed-fixed / unstuffed-fixed ) CRLF
stuffed-fixed		= *text-char non-sp
unstuffed-fixed	= non-sp-quote [ *text-char non-sp ]
sig-sep					= [ quote [stuffing] ] "--" SP CRLF
quote-mark			 = ">"
quote						= 1*quote-mark
stuffing				 = SP ; space-stuffed, added on generation if
											; needed, deleted on reception
flow						 = SP ; space before CRLF indicates flowed line,
											; if DelSp=yes, space was added on generation
											; and is deleted on reception
non-sp-quote		 = < any character except NUL, CR, LF, SP, quote-mark >
non-sp					 = non-sp-quote / quote-mark
text-char				= non-sp / SP

	 That is, a Format=Flowed message body consists of any number of
	 paragraphs and/or fixed lines and/or signature separator lines;
	 paragraphs need at least one flowed line and are terminated by a
	 fixed line; the fixed line terminating the paragraph is part of the
	 paragraph.	(There are some exceptions to this described in the
	 text.)

	 Without at least one flowed line, there is a series of fixed lines,
	 each independent.	There is no paragraph.

	 With at least one flowed line, there is a paragraph, and the received
	 lines can be reformed and flowed to fit the display window size.
	 This can only be done if the lines are part of a logical grouping,
	 the paragraph.

	 Note that the definitions of flowed-line and sig-sep are potentially
	 ambiguous: a signature separator line matches both, but is treated as
	 a signature separator line and not a flowed line.

7.	Failure Modes

7.1.	Trailing White Space Corruption

	 There are systems in existence which alter trailing whitespace on
	 messages which pass through them.	Such systems may strip, or in
	 rarer cases, add trailing whitespace, in violation of RFC 2821 [SMTP]
	 Section 4.5.2.

	 Stripping trailing whitespace has the effect of converting flowed
	 lines to fixed lines, which results in a message no worse than if
	 Format=Flowed had not been used.




Gellens										 Standards Track										[Page 14]

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


	 Adding trailing whitespace to a Format=Flowed message may result in a
	 malformed display or reply.

	 Since most systems which add trailing white space do so to create a
	 line which fills an internal record format, the result is almost
	 always a line which contains an even number of characters (counting
	 the added trailing white space).

	 One possible avoidance, therefore, would be to define Format=Flowed
	 lines to use either one or two trailing space characters to indicate
	 a flowed line, such that the total line length is odd.	However,
	 considering the scarcity of such systems today, it is not worth the
	 added complexity.

8.	Security Considerations

	 Any security considerations which apply to Text/Plain also apply to
	 Text/Plain with Format=Flowed.

	 Section 4.6 discusses the interaction between Format=Flowed and
	 digital signatures or encryption.

9.	IANA Considerations

	 IANA has added a reference to this specification in the Text/Plain
	 Media Type registration.

10.	Internationalization Considerations

	 The line wrap and quoting specifications of Format=Flowed may not be
	 suitable for certain charsets, such as for Arabic and Hebrew
	 characters that read from right to left.	Care needs to be taken in
	 applying format=flowed in these cases, as format=fixed combined with
	 [quoted-printable] encoding may be more suitable.

	 The DelSp parameter was added specifically to permit Format=Flowed to
	 be used with languages/coded character sets in which the ASCII space
	 character is rarely used, or not used at all.

11.	Acknowledgments

	 The DelSp parameter was developed during a series of discussions
	 among a number of people, including Harald Alvestrand, Grant Baillie,
	 Ian Bell, Steve Dorner, Patrik Faltstrom, Eric Fischer, Ned Freed,
	 Alexey Melnikov, John Myers, and Pete Resnick.

RFC 3676				 Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters		February 2004


	 The DelSp parameter was added specifically to permit Format=Flowed to
	 be used with languages/coded character sets in which the ASCII space
	 character is rarely used, or not used at all.	The DelSp mechanism
	 was selected despite having been initially rejected as too much of a
	 kludge, because among the many different techniques proposed, it
	 allows for maximum interoperability among clients which support
	 neither this specification nor RFC 2646, those which do support RFC
	 2646 but not this specification, and those that do support this
	 specification; this set is multiplied by those that handle
	 languages/coded character sets in which spaces are common, and in
	 which they are uncommon or not used.
