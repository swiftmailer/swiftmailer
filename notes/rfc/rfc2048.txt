								 Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
													 (MIME) Part Four:
												Registration Procedures

Status of this Memo

	 This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
	 Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
	 improvements.	Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

	 STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying
	 considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the
	 message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.	This set of
	 documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail
	 Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for

		(1)	 textual message bodies in character sets other than
					US-ASCII,

		(2)	 an extensible set of different formats for non-textual
					message bodies,

		(3)	 multi-part message bodies, and

		(4)	 textual header information in character sets other than
					US-ASCII.

	 These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD
	 11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.	Because RFC 822 said
	 so little about message bodies, these documents are largely
	 orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


	 This fourth document, RFC 2048, specifies various IANA registration
	 procedures for the following MIME facilities:

		(1)	 media types,

		(2)	 external body access types,

		(3)	 content-transfer-encodings.

	 Registration of character sets for use in MIME is covered elsewhere
	 and is no longer addressed by this document.

	 These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521 and 1522, which themselves
	 were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.	An appendix in RFC 2049
	 describes differences and changes from previous versions.

1.	Introduction

	 Recent Internet protocols have been carefully designed to be easily
	 extensible in certain areas.	In particular, MIME [RFC 2045] is an
	 open-ended framework and can accommodate additional object types,
	 character sets, and access methods without any changes to the basic
	 protocol.	A registration process is needed, however, to ensure that
	 the set of such values is developed in an orderly, well-specified,
	 and public manner.

	 This document defines registration procedures which use the Internet
	 Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for such
	 values.

	 Historical Note: The registration process for media types was
	 initially defined in the context of the asynchronous Internet mail
	 environment.	In this mail environment there is a need to limit the
	 number of possible media types to increase the likelihood of
	 interoperability when the capabilities of the remote mail system are
	 not known.	As media types are used in new environments, where the
	 proliferation of media types is not a hindrance to interoperability,
	 the original procedure was excessively restrictive and had to be
	 generalized.

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


2.	Media Type Registration

	 Registration of a new media type or types starts with the
	 construction of a registration proposal.	Registration may occur in
	 several different registration trees, which have different
	 requirements as discussed below.	In general, the new registration
	 proposal is circulated and reviewed in a fashion appropriate to the
	 tree involved.	The media type is then registered if the proposal is
	 acceptable.	The following sections describe the requirements and
	 procedures used for each of the different registration trees.

2.1.	Registration Trees and Subtype Names

	 In order to increase the efficiency and flexibility of the
	 registration process, different structures of subtype names may be
	 registered to accomodate the different natural requirements for,
	 e.g., a subtype that will be recommended for wide support and
	 implementation by the Internet Community or a subtype that is used to
	 move files associated with proprietary software.	The following
	 subsections define registration "trees", distinguished by the use of
	 faceted names (e.g., names of the form "tree.subtree...type").	Note
	 that some media types defined prior to this document do not conform
	 to the naming conventions described below.	See Appendix A for a
	 discussion of them.

2.1.1.	IETF Tree

	 The IETF tree is intended for types of general interest to the
	 Internet Community. Registration in the IETF tree requires approval
	 by the IESG and publication of the media type registration as some
	 form of RFC.

	 Media types in the IETF tree are normally denoted by names that are
	 not explicitly faceted, i.e., do not contain period (".", full stop)
	 characters.

	 The "owner" of a media type registration in the IETF tree is assumed
	 to be the IETF itself.	Modification or alteration of the
	 specification requires the same level of processing (e.g.	standards
	 track) required for the initial registration.

2.1.2.	Vendor Tree

	 The vendor tree is used for media types associated with commercially
	 available products.	"Vendor" or "producer" are construed as
	 equivalent and very broadly in this context.





Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice									[Page 4]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


	 A registration may be placed in the vendor tree by anyone who has
	 need to interchange files associated with the particular product.
	 However, the registration formally belongs to the vendor or
	 organization producing the software or file format.	Changes to the
	 specification will be made at their request, as discussed in
	 subsequent sections.

	 Registrations in the vendor tree will be distinguished by the leading
	 facet "vnd.".	That may be followed, at the discretion of the
	 registration, by either a media type name from a well-known producer
	 (e.g., "vnd.mudpie") or by an IANA-approved designation of the
	 producer's name which is then followed by a media type or product
	 designation (e.g., vnd.bigcompany.funnypictures).

	 While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in
	 the vendor tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for review
	 is strongly encouraged to improve the quality of those
	 specifications. Registrations in the vendor tree may be submitted
	 directly to the IANA.

2.1.3.	Personal or Vanity Tree

	 Registrations for media types created experimentally or as part of
	 products that are not distributed commercially may be registered in
	 the personal or vanity tree.	The registrations are distinguished by
	 the leading facet "prs.".

	 The owner of "personal" registrations and associated specifications
	 is the person or entity making the registration, or one to whom
	 responsibility has been transferred as described below.

	 While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in
	 the personal tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for
	 review is strongly encouraged to improve the quality of those
	 specifications.	Registrations in the personl tree may be submitted
	 directly to the IANA.

2.1.4.	Special `x.' Tree

	 For convenience and symmetry with this registration scheme, media
	 type names with "x." as the first facet may be used for the same
	 purposes for which names starting in "x-" are normally used.	These
	 types are unregistered, experimental, and should be used only with
	 the active agreement of the parties exchanging them.







Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice									[Page 5]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


	 However, with the simplified registration procedures described above
	 for vendor and personal trees, it should rarely, if ever, be
	 necessary to use unregistered experimental types, and as such use of
	 both "x-" and "x." forms is discouraged.

2.1.5.	Additional Registration Trees

	 From time to time and as required by the community, the IANA may,
	 with the advice and consent of the IESG, create new top-level
	 registration trees.	It is explicitly assumed that these trees may be
	 created for external registration and management by well-known
	 permanent bodies, such as scientific societies for media types
	 specific to the sciences they cover.	In general, the quality of
	 review of specifications for one of these additional registration
	 trees is expected to be equivalent to that which IETF would give to
	 registrations in its own tree. Establishment of these new trees will
	 be announced through RFC publication approved by the IESG.

2.2.	Registration Requirements

	 Media type registration proposals are all expected to conform to
	 various requirements laid out in the following sections.	Note that
	 requirement specifics sometimes vary depending on the registration
	 tree, again as detailed in the following sections.

2.2.1.	Functionality Requirement

	 Media types must function as an actual media format: Registration of
	 things that are better thought of as a transfer encoding, as a
	 character set, or as a collection of separate entities of another
	 type, is not allowed.	For example, although applications exist to
	 decode the base64 transfer encoding [RFC 2045], base64 cannot be
	 registered as a media type.

	 This requirement applies regardless of the registration tree
	 involved.

2.2.2.	Naming Requirements

	 All registered media types must be assigned MIME type and subtype
	 names. The combination of these names then serves to uniquely
	 identify the media type and the format of the subtype name identifies
	 the registration tree.

	 The choice of top-level type name must take the nature of media type
	 involved into account. For example, media normally used for
	 representing still images should be a subtype of the image content
	 type, whereas media capable of representing audio information belongs



Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice									[Page 6]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


	 under the audio content type. See RFC 2046 for additional information
	 on the basic set of top-level types and their characteristics.

	 New subtypes of top-level types must conform to the restrictions of
	 the top-level type, if any. For example, all subtypes of the
	 multipart content type must use the same encapsulation syntax.

	 In some cases a new media type may not "fit" under any currently
	 defined top-level content type. Such cases are expected to be quite
	 rare. However, if such a case arises a new top-level type can be
	 defined to accommodate it. Such a definition must be done via
	 standards-track RFC; no other mechanism can be used to define
	 additional top-level content types.

	 These requirements apply regardless of the registration tree
	 involved.

2.2.3.	Parameter Requirements

	 Media types may elect to use one or more MIME content type
	 parameters, or some parameters may be automatically made available to
	 the media type by virtue of being a subtype of a content type that
	 defines a set of parameters applicable to any of its subtypes.	In
	 either case, the names, values, and meanings of any parameters must
	 be fully specified when a media type is registered in the IETF tree,
	 and should be specified as completely as possible when media types
	 are registered in the vendor or personal trees.

	 New parameters must not be defined as a way to introduce new
	 functionality in types registered in the IETF tree, although new
	 parameters may be added to convey additional information that does
	 not otherwise change existing functionality.	An example of this
	 would be a "revision" parameter to indicate a revision level of an
	 external specification such as JPEG.	Similar behavior is encouraged
	 for media types registered in the vendor or personal trees but is not
	 required.

2.2.4.	Canonicalization and Format Requirements

	 All registered media types must employ a single, canonical data
	 format, regardless of registration tree.

	 A precise and openly available specification of the format of each
	 media type is required for all types registered in the IETF tree and
	 must at a minimum be referenced by, if it isn't actually included in,
	 the media type registration proposal itself.





Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice									[Page 7]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


	 The specifications of format and processing particulars may or may
	 not be publically available for media types registered in the vendor
	 tree, and such registration proposals are explicitly permitted to
	 include only a specification of which software and version produce or
	 process such media types.	References to or inclusion of format
	 specifications in registration proposals is encouraged but not
	 required.

	 Format specifications are still required for registration in the
	 personal tree, but may be either published as RFCs or otherwise
	 deposited with IANA. The deposited specifications will meet the same
	 criteria as those required to register a well-known TCP port and, in
	 particular, need not be made public.

	 Some media types involve the use of patented technology.	The
	 registration of media types involving patented technology is
	 specifically permitted.	However, the restrictions set forth in RFC
	 1602 on the use of patented technology in standards-track protocols
	 must be respected when the specification of a media type is part of a
	 standards-track protocol.

2.2.5.	Interchange Recommendations

	 Media types should, whenever possible, interoperate across as many
	 systems and applications as possible. However, some media types will
	 inevitably have problems interoperating across different platforms.
	 Problems with different versions, byte ordering, and specifics of
	 gateway handling can and will arise.

	 Universal interoperability of media types is not required, but known
	 interoperability issues should be identified whenever possible.
	 Publication of a media type does not require an exhaustive review of
	 interoperability, and the interoperability considerations section is
	 subject to continuing evaluation.

	 These recommendations apply regardless of the registration tree
	 involved.

2.2.6.	Security Requirements

	 An analysis of security issues is required for for all types
	 registered in the IETF Tree.	(This is in accordance with the basic
	 requirements for all IETF protocols.) A similar analysis for media
	 types registered in the vendor or personal trees is encouraged but
	 not required.	However, regardless of what security analysis has or
	 has not been done, all descriptions of security issues must be as
	 accurate as possible regardless of registration tree.	In particular,
	 a statement that there are "no security issues associated with this



Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice									[Page 8]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


	 type" must not be confused with "the security issues associates with
	 this type have not been assessed".

	 There is absolutely no requirement that media types registered in any
	 tree be secure or completely free from risks.	Nevertheless, all
	 known security risks must be identified in the registration of a
	 media type, again regardless of registration tree.

	 The security considerations section of all registrations is subject
	 to continuing evaluation and modification, and in particular may be
	 extended by use of the "comments on media types" mechanism described
	 in subsequent sections.

	 Some of the issues that should be looked at in a security analysis of
	 a media type are:

		(1)	 Complex media types may include provisions for
					directives that institute actions on a recipient's
					files or other resources.	In many cases provision is
					made for originators to specify arbitrary actions in an
					unrestricted fashion which may then have devastating
					effects.	See the registration of the
					application/postscript media type in RFC 2046 for
					an example of such directives and how to handle them.

		(2)	 Complex media types may include provisions for
					directives that institute actions which, while not
					directly harmful to the recipient, may result in
					disclosure of information that either facilitates a
					subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's
					privacy in some way.	Again, the registration of the
					application/postscript media type illustrates how such
					directives can be handled.

		(3)	 A media type might be targeted for applications that
					require some sort of security assurance but not provide
					the necessary security mechanisms themselves. For
					example, a media type could be defined for storage of
					confidential medical information which in turn requires
					an external confidentiality service.

2.2.7.	Usage and Implementation Non-requirements

	 In the asynchronous mail environment, where information on the
	 capabilities of the remote mail agent is frequently not available to
	 the sender, maximum interoperability is attained by restricting the
	 number of media types used to those "common" formats expected to be
	 widely implemented.	This was asserted in the past as a reason to



Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice									[Page 9]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


	 limit the number of possible media types and resulted in a
	 registration process with a significant hurdle and delay for those
	 registering media types.

	 However, the need for "common" media types does not require limiting
	 the registration of new media types. If a limited set of media types
	 is recommended for a particular application, that should be asserted
	 by a separate applicability statement specific for the application
	 and/or environment.

	 As such, universal support and implementation of a media type is NOT
	 a requirement for registration.	If, however, a media type is
	 explicitly intended for limited use, this should be noted in its
	 registration.

2.2.8.	Publication Requirements

	 Proposals for media types registered in the IETF tree must be
	 published as RFCs. RFC publication of vendor and personal media type
	 proposals is encouraged but not required. In all cases IANA will
	 retain copies of all media type proposals and "publish" them as part
	 of the media types registration tree itself.

	 Other than in the IETF tree, the registration of a data type does not
	 imply endorsement, approval, or recommendation by IANA or IETF or
	 even certification that the specification is adequate.	To become
	 Internet Standards, protocol, data objects, or whatever must go
	 through the IETF standards process.	This is too difficult and too
	 lengthy a process for the convenient registration of media types.

	 The IETF tree exists for media types that do require require a
	 substantive review and approval process with the vendor and personal
	 trees exist for those that do not. It is expected that applicability
	 statements for particular applications will be published from time to
	 time that recommend implementation of, and support for, media types
	 that have proven particularly useful in those contexts.

	 As discussed above, registration of a top-level type requires
	 standards-track processing and, hence, RFC publication.

2.2.9.	Additional Information

	 Various sorts of optional information may be included in the
	 specification of a media type if it is available:

		(1)	 Magic number(s) (length, octet values). Magic numbers
					are byte sequences that are always present and thus can
					be used to identify entities as being of a given media



Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice								 [Page 10]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


					type.

		(2)	 File extension(s) commonly used on one or more
					platforms to indicate that some file containing a given
					type of media.

		(3)	 Macintosh File Type code(s) (4 octets) used to label
					files containing a given type of media.

	 Such information is often quite useful to implementors and if
	 available should be provided.

2.3.	Registration Procedure

	 The following procedure has been implemented by the IANA for review
	 and approval of new media types.	This is not a formal standards
	 process, but rather an administrative procedure intended to allow
	 community comment and sanity checking without excessive time delay.
	 For registration in the IETF tree, the normal IETF processes should
	 be followed, treating posting of an internet-draft and announcement
	 on the ietf-types list (as described in the next subsection) as a
	 first step.	For registrations in the vendor or personal tree, the
	 initial review step described below may be omitted and the type
	 registered directly by submitting the template and an explanation
	 directly to IANA (at iana@iana.org).	However, authors of vendor or
	 personal media type specifications are encouraged to seek community
	 review and comment whenever that is feasible.

2.3.1.	Present the Media Type to the Community for Review

	 Send a proposed media type registration to the "ietf-types@iana.org"
	 mailing list for a two week review period.	This mailing list has
	 been established for the purpose of reviewing proposed media and
	 access types. Proposed media types are not formally registered and
	 must not be used; the "x-" prefix specified in RFC 2045 can be used
	 until registration is complete.

	 The intent of the public posting is to solicit comments and feedback
	 on the choice of type/subtype name, the unambiguity of the references
	 with respect to versions and external profiling information, and a
	 review of any interoperability or security considerations. The
	 submitter may submit a revised registration, or withdraw the
	 registration completely, at any time.








Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice								 [Page 11]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


2.3.2.	IESG Approval

	 Media types registered in the IETF tree must be submitted to the IESG
	 for approval.

2.3.3.	IANA Registration

	 Provided that the media type meets the requirements for media types
	 and has obtained approval that is necessary, the author may submit
	 the registration request to the IANA, which will register the media
	 type and make the media type registration available to the community.

2.4.	Comments on Media Type Registrations

	 Comments on registered media types may be submitted by members of the
	 community to IANA.	These comments will be passed on to the "owner"
	 of the media type if possible.	Submitters of comments may request
	 that their comment be attached to the media type registration itself,
	 and if IANA approves of this the comment will be made accessible in
	 conjunction with the type registration itself.

2.5.	Location of Registered Media Type List

	 Media type registrations will be posted in the anonymous FTP
	 directory "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/"
	 and all registered media types will be listed in the periodically
	 issued "Assigned Numbers" RFC [currently STD 2, RFC 1700].	The media
	 type description and other supporting material may also be published
	 as an Informational RFC by sending it to "rfc-editor@isi.edu" (please
	 follow the instructions to RFC authors [RFC-1543]).

2.6.	IANA Procedures for Registering Media Types

	 The IANA will only register media types in the IETF tree in response
	 to a communication from the IESG stating that a given registration
	 has been approved. Vendor and personal types will be registered by
	 the IANA automatically and without any formal review as long as the
	 following minimal conditions are met:

		(1)	 Media types must function as an actual media format.
					In particular, character sets and transfer encodings
					may not be registered as media types.

		(2)	 All media types must have properly formed type and
					subtype names. All type names must be defined by a
					standards-track RFC. All subtype names must be unique,
					must conform to the MIME grammar for such names, and
					must contain the proper tree prefix.



Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice								 [Page 12]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


		(3)	 Types registered in the personal tree must either
					provide a format specification or a pointer to one.

		(4)	 Any security considerations given must not be obviously
					bogus. (It is neither possible nor necessary for the
					IANA to conduct a comprehensive security review of
					media type registrations.	Nevertheless, IANA has the
					authority to identify obviously incompetent material
					and exclude it.)

2.7.	Change Control

	 Once a media type has been published by IANA, the author may request
	 a change to its definition. The descriptions of the different
	 registration trees above designate the "owners" of each type of
	 registration. The change request follows the same procedure as the
	 registration request:

		(1)	 Publish the revised template on the ietf-types list.

		(2)	 Leave at least two weeks for comments.

		(3)	 Publish using IANA after formal review if required.

	 Changes should be requested only when there are serious omission or
	 errors in the published specification. When review is required, a
	 change request may be denied if it renders entities that were valid
	 under the previous definition invalid under the new definition.

	 The owner of a content type may pass responsibility for the content
	 type to another person or agency by informing IANA and the ietf-types
	 list; this can be done without discussion or review.

	 The IESG may reassign responsibility for a media type. The most
	 common case of this will be to enable changes to be made to types
	 where the author of the registration has died, moved out of contact
	 or is otherwise unable to make changes that are important to the
	 community.

	 Media type registrations may not be deleted; media types which are no
	 longer believed appropriate for use can be declared OBSOLETE by a
	 change to their "intended use" field; such media types will be
	 clearly marked in the lists published by IANA.

3.	External Body Access Types

	 RFC 2046 defines the message/external-body media type, whereby a MIME
	 entity can act as pointer to the actual body data in lieu of
	 including the data directly in the entity body. Each
	 message/external-body reference specifies an access type, which
	 determines the mechanism used to retrieve the actual body data. RFC
	 2046 defines an initial set of access types, but allows for the

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


	 registration of additional access types to accommodate new retrieval
	 mechanisms.

3.1.	Registration Requirements

	 New access type specifications must conform to a number of
	 requirements as described below.

3.1.1.	Naming Requirements

	 Each access type must have a unique name.	This name appears in the
	 access-type parameter in the message/external-body content-type
	 header field, and must conform to MIME content type parameter syntax.

3.1.2.	Mechanism Specification Requirements

	 All of the protocols, transports, and procedures used by a given
	 access type must be described, either in the specification of the
	 access type itself or in some other publicly available specification,
	 in sufficient detail for the access type to be implemented by any
	 competent implementor.	Use of secret and/or proprietary methods in
	 access types are expressly prohibited. The restrictions imposed by
	 RFC 1602 on the standardization of patented algorithms must be
	 respected as well.

3.1.3.	Publication Requirements

	 All access types must be described by an RFC. The RFC may be
	 informational rather than standards-track, although standard-track
	 review and approval are encouraged for all access types.

3.1.4.	Security Requirements

	 Any known security issues that arise from the use of the access type
	 must be completely and fully described. It is not required that the
	 access type be secure or that it be free from risks, but that the
	 known risks be identified.	Publication of a new access type does not
	 require an exhaustive security review, and the security
	 considerations section is subject to continuing evaluation.
	 Additional security considerations should be addressed by publishing
	 revised versions of the access type specification.

3.2.	Registration Procedure

	 Registration of a new access type starts with the construction of a
	 draft of an RFC.





Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice								 [Page 15]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


3.2.1.	Present the Access Type to the Community

	 Send a proposed access type specification to the "ietf-
	 types@iana.org" mailing list for a two week review period.	This
	 mailing list has been established for the purpose of reviewing
	 proposed access and media types.	Proposed access types are not
	 formally registered and must not be used.

	 The intent of the public posting is to solicit comments and feedback
	 on the access type specification and a review of any security
	 considerations.

3.2.2.	Access Type Reviewer

	 When the two week period has passed, the access type reviewer, who is
	 appointed by the IETF Applications Area Director, either forwards the
	 request to iana@isi.edu, or rejects it because of significant
	 objections raised on the list.

	 Decisions made by the reviewer must be posted to the ietf-types
	 mailing list within 14 days. Decisions made by the reviewer may be
	 appealed to the IESG.

3.2.3.	IANA Registration

	 Provided that the access type has either passed review or has been
	 successfully appealed to the IESG, the IANA will register the access
	 type and make the registration available to the community. The
	 specification of the access type must also be published as an RFC.
	 Informational RFCs are published by sending them to "rfc-
	 editor@isi.edu" (please follow the instructions to RFC authors [RFC-
	 1543]).

3.3.	Location of Registered Access Type List

	 Access type registrations will be posted in the anonymous FTP
	 directory "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/access-types/"
	 and all registered access types will be listed in the periodically
	 issued "Assigned Numbers" RFC [currently RFC-1700].

3.4.	IANA Procedures for Registering Access Types

	 The identity of the access type reviewer is communicated to the IANA
	 by the IESG.	The IANA then only acts in response to access type
	 definitions that either are approved by the access type reviewer and
	 forwarded by the reviewer to the IANA for registration, or in
	 response to a communication from the IESG that an access type
	 definition appeal has overturned the access type reviewer's ruling.

4.	Transfer Encodings

	 Transfer encodings are tranformations applied to MIME media types
	 after conversion to the media type's canonical form.	Transfer
	 encodings are used for several purposes:

		(1)	 Many transports, especially message transports, can
					only handle data consisting of relatively short lines
					of text. There can also be severe restrictions on what
					characters can be used in these lines of text -- some
					transports are restricted to a small subset of US-ASCII
					and others cannot handle certain character sequences.
					Transfer encodings are used to transform binary data
					into textual form that can survive such transports.
					Examples of this sort of transfer encoding include the
					base64 and quoted-printable transfer encodings defined
					in RFC 2045.

		(2)	 Image, audio, video, and even application entities are
					sometimes quite large. Compression algorithms are often
					quite effective in reducing the size of large entities.
					Transfer encodings can be used to apply general-purpose
					non-lossy compression algorithms to MIME entities.

		(3)	 Transport encodings can be defined as a means of
					representing existing encoding formats in a MIME
					context.

	 IMPORTANT:	The standardization of a large numbers of different
	 transfer encodings is seen as a significant barrier to widespread
	 interoperability and is expressely discouraged.	Nevertheless, the
	 following procedure has been defined to provide a means of defining
	 additional transfer encodings, should standardization actually be
	 justified.

4.1.	Transfer Encoding Requirements

	 Transfer encoding specifications must conform to a number of
	 requirements as described below.

4.1.1.	Naming Requirements

	 Each transfer encoding must have a unique name.	This name appears in
	 the Content-Transfer-Encoding header field and must conform to the
	 syntax of that field.






Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice								 [Page 17]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


4.1.2.	Algorithm Specification Requirements

	 All of the algorithms used in a transfer encoding (e.g.	conversion
	 to printable form, compression) must be described in their entirety
	 in the transfer encoding specification.	Use of secret and/or
	 proprietary algorithms in standardized transfer encodings are
	 expressly prohibited. The restrictions imposed by RFC 1602 on the
	 standardization of patented algorithms must be respected as well.

4.1.3.	Input Domain Requirements

	 All transfer encodings must be applicable to an arbitrary sequence of
	 octets of any length.	Dependence on particular input forms is not
	 allowed.

	 It should be noted that the 7bit and 8bit encodings do not conform to
	 this requirement. Aside from the undesireability of having
	 specialized encodings, the intent here is to forbid the addition of
	 additional encodings along the lines of 7bit and 8bit.

4.1.4.	Output Range Requirements

	 There is no requirement that a particular tranfer encoding produce a
	 particular form of encoded output.	However, the output format for
	 each transfer encoding must be fully and completely documented.	In
	 particular, each specification must clearly state whether the output
	 format always lies within the confines of 7bit data, 8bit data, or is
	 simply pure binary data.

4.1.5.	Data Integrity and Generality Requirements

	 All transfer encodings must be fully invertible on any platform; it
	 must be possible for anyone to recover the original data by
	 performing the corresponding decoding operation.	Note that this
	 requirement effectively excludes all forms of lossy compression as
	 well as all forms of encryption from use as a transfer encoding.

4.1.6.	New Functionality Requirements

	 All transfer encodings must provide some sort of new functionality.
	 Some degree of functionality overlap with previously defined transfer
	 encodings is acceptable, but any new transfer encoding must also
	 offer something no other transfer encoding provides.








Freed, et. al.					 Best Current Practice								 [Page 18]

RFC 2048							MIME Registration Procedures				 November 1996


4.2.	Transfer Encoding Definition Procedure

	 Definition of a new transfer encoding starts with the construction of
	 a draft of a standards-track RFC.	The RFC must define the transfer
	 encoding precisely and completely, and must also provide substantial
	 justification for defining and standardizing a new transfer encoding.
	 This specification must then be presented to the IESG for
	 consideration.	The IESG can

		(1)	 reject the specification outright as being
					inappropriate for standardization,

		(2)	 approve the formation of an IETF working group to work
					on the specification in accordance with IETF
					procedures, or,

		(3)	 accept the specification as-is and put it directly on
					the standards track.

	 Transfer encoding specifications on the standards track follow normal
	 IETF rules for standards track documents.	A transfer encoding is
	 considered to be defined and available for use once it is on the
	 standards track.

4.3.	IANA Procedures for Transfer Encoding Registration

	 There is no need for a special procedure for registering Transfer
	 Encodings with the IANA. All legitimate transfer encoding
	 registrations must appear as a standards-track RFC, so it is the
	 IESG's responsibility to notify the IANA when a new transfer encoding
	 has been approved.

4.4.	Location of Registered Transfer Encodings List

	 Transfer encoding registrations will be posted in the anonymous FTP
	 directory "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/transfer-
	 encodings/" and all registered transfer encodings will be listed in
	 the periodically issued "Assigned Numbers" RFC [currently RFC-1700].

Appendix A -- Grandfathered Media Types

	 A number of media types, registered prior to 1996, would, if
	 registered under the guidelines in this document, be placed into
	 either the vendor or personal trees.	Reregistration of those types
	 to reflect the appropriate trees is encouraged, but not required.
	 Ownership and change control principles outlined in this document
	 apply to those types as if they had been registered in the trees
	 described above.
