`7.0` would be MUCH better than `nighlty` because nightly is actually php 7.1.

Or rather, it's meant to be according the original RFC that said the master branch would become 7.1 immaculately following the RC1 release of 7.0.

I managed to reproduce the segfaults on PHP5.3 and PHP5.6 on my machine. I'm trying to understand why it happens though.

Back to green! Disabling GC prevents segfaults when running PHPUnit.
