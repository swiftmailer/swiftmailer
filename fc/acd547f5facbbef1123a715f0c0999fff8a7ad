I don't know why the tests suite ends up with a segfault on PHP 5.3. On my machine (PHP 5.6.12), the test suite also segfaults when I run unit tests after a fresh checkout of the repository + composer install command.

PHP 5.3 is pretty dead on TravisCi, and try disabling the gc as used in https://github.com/symfony/phpunit-bridge/blob/2.7/bootstrap.php#L11-L15

@stof also any reasons why the build matrix allows failures for PHP 5.6? Shouldn't we officially support PHP5.6 with Swiftmailer?

@hhamon no idea

So we can add PHP 5.6 to the list of supported versions I guess.

Probably because 5.6 did not work back then. It should indeed be re-integrated into the main matrix, and hopefully PHP7 as well.
