@Zenexer Can you explicitly give permission to use you code in Swiftmailer under the MIT license?

Thanks @barryvdh. If @Zenexer is ok for us to use his snippet of code, I will go ahead and release a new version of Swiftmailer.

Actually, I will do one more thing: deprecate the Mail transport and remove it in 6.0.

905b0bc deprecates the mail transport. The reasoning being that as `mail()` has many drawbacks besides security (as mentioned in the phpdocs) and because this is just a wrapper on top of `sendmail`, there is no need to keep it.

@barryvdh Can you add a note in the `CHANGES` file?
