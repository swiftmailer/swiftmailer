@fabpot Are there any news for accepting this?

As a side effect, this also fixes #1073.

I agree, if there are BCC-recipients, Swift should not split it into separate mails.
Stripping BCC is handled at the destination email server.

Any reason why this great PR is not merged yet?
Would fix #1073, #1074 and #1132
