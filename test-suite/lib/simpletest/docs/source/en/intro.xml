				<introduction>
						<p>
								The <a local="simple_test">SimpleTest PHP unit tester</a> is in
								the 1.0.1 release cycle and is available for download from your nearest <a
								href="http://souceforge.net/projects/simpletest/">SourceForge</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
								It is a PHP unit test, mock objects and web test framework.
								Users of <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> will be
								familiar with most of the interface.
								For web testing a small web browser is included, similar to
								<a href="http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/">JWebUnit</a>.
								It has support for SSL, frames, proxies, basic authentication, redirects,
								and the standard HTML form controls.
								The idea is that common but fiddly PHP tasks, such as logging into a site,
								can be tested easily as calling <code>click()</code>.
						</p>
						<p>
								There is currently no support for JavaScript in the web tester.
								For testing these elements we recommend
								<a href="http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/index.html">Selenium</a>.
