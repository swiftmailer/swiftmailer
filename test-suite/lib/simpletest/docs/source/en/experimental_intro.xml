				<section name="intro" title="Why only in SVN">
						<p>
								If a bug is found in SimpleTest, chances are it'll get corrected
								inside the Subversion (SVN) tree with the corresponding test case : just to make
								sure the bug doesn't make a come back later on.
						</p>
						<p>
								Also the SimpleTest SVN trunk is usually full of little known
								experiments with code : new ideas are usually tried out there
								before a general release. Before it happens, the documentation needs
								to be completed : that's where this section comes into place. You'll
								find here new features the dev team is happy with : we're looking
								for comments...
						</p>
						<p>
								The mailing-list is usually the best place to give feedback. Other options
								includes submitting a bug or a patch directly on the Sourceforge trackers...
						</p>
						<p class="experimental">
								Note : some of these features may never make it to a release or not for
								a long time!
