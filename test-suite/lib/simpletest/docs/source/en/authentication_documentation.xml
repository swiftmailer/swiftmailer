				<introduction>
						<p>
								One of the trickiest, and yet most important, areas
								of testing web sites is the security.
								Testing these schemes is one of the core goals of
								the SimpleTest web tester.
						</p>
				</introduction>
				<section name="basic" title="Basic HTTP authentication">
						<p>
								If you fetch a page protected by basic authentication then
								rather than receiving content, you will instead get a 401
								header.
								We can illustrate this with this test...
<php><![CDATA[
class AuthenticationTest extends WebTestCase {<strong>
		function test401Header() {
				$this->get('http://www.lastcraft.com/protected/');
				$this->showHeaders();
		}</strong>
}
]]></php>
								This allows us to see the challenge header...
								<div class="demo">
										<h1>File test</h1>
<pre style="background-color: lightgray; color: black"><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
Date: Sat, 18 Sep 2004 19:25:18 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.29 (Unix) PHP/4.3.4
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="SimpleTest basic authentication"
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
]]></pre>
										<div style="padding: 8px; margin-top: 1em; background-color: green; color: white;">1/1 test cases complete.
										<strong>0</strong> passes, <strong>0</strong> fails and <strong>0</strong> exceptions.</div>
								</div>
								We are trying to get away from visual inspection though, and so SimpleTest
								allows to make automated assertions against the challenge.
								Here is a thorough test of our header...
<php><![CDATA[
class AuthenticationTest extends WebTestCase {
		function test401Header() {
				$this->get('http://www.lastcraft.com/protected/');<strong>
				$this->assertAuthentication('Basic');
				$this->assertResponse(401);
				$this->assertRealm('SimpleTest basic authentication');</strong>
		}
}
]]></php>
								Any one of these tests would normally do on it's own depending
								on the amount of detail you want to see.
						</p>
						<p>
								One theme that runs through SimpleTest is the ability to use
								<code>SimpleExpectation</code> objects wherever a simple
								match is not enough.
								If you want only an approximate match to the realm for
								example, you can do this...
<php><![CDATA[
class AuthenticationTest extends WebTestCase {
		function test401Header() {
				$this->get('http://www.lastcraft.com/protected/');
				$this->assertRealm(<strong>new PatternExpectation('/simpletest/i')</strong>);
		}
}
]]></php>
								This type of test, testing HTTP responses, is not typical.
						</p>
						<p>
								Most of the time we are not interested in testing the
								authentication itself, but want to get past it to test
								the pages underneath.
								As soon as the challenge has been issued we can reply with
								an authentication response...
<php><![CDATA[
class AuthenticationTest extends WebTestCase {
		function testCanAuthenticate() {
				$this->get('http://www.lastcraft.com/protected/');<strong>
				$this->authenticate('Me', 'Secret');</strong>
				$this->assertTitle(...);
		}
}
]]></php>
								The username and password will now be sent with every
								subsequent request to that directory and subdirectories.
								You will have to authenticate again if you step outside
								the authenticated directory, but SimpleTest is smart enough
								to merge subdirectories into a common realm.
						</p>
						<p>
								If you want, you can shortcut this step further by encoding
								the log in details straight into the URL...
<php><![CDATA[
class AuthenticationTest extends WebTestCase {
		function testCanReadAuthenticatedPages() {
				$this->get('http://<strong>Me:Secret@</strong>www.lastcraft.com/protected/');
				$this->assertTitle(...);
		}
}
]]></php>
								If your username or password has special characters, then you
								will have to URL encode them or the request will not be parsed
								correctly.
								I'm afraid we leave this up to you.
						</p>
						<p>
								A problem with encoding the login details directly in the URL is
								the authentication header will not be sent on subsequent requests.
								If you navigate with relative URLs though, the authentication
								information will be preserved along with the domain name.
						</p>
						<p>
								Normally though, you use the <code>authenticate()</code> call.
								SimpleTest will then remember your login information on each request.
						</p>
						<p>
								Only testing with basic authentication is currently supported, and
								this is only really secure in tandem with HTTPS connections.
								This is usually good enough to protect test server from prying eyes,
								however.
								Digest authentication and NTLM authentication may be added
								in the future if enough people request this feature.
						</p>
				</section>
				<section name="cookies" title="Cookies">
						<p>
								Basic authentication doesn't give enough control over the
								user interface for web developers.
								More likely this functionality will be coded directly into
								the web architecture using cookies with complicated timeouts.
								We need to be able to test this too.
						</p>
						<p>
								Starting with a simple log-in form...
<pre><![CDATA[
<form>
		Username:
		<input type="text" name="u" value="" /><br />
		Password:
		<input type="password" name="p" value="" /><br />
		<input type="submit" value="Log in" />
</form>
]]></pre>
								Which looks like...
						</p>
						<p>
								<form class="demo">
										Username:
										<input type="text" name="u" value="" /><br />
										Password:
										<input type="password" name="p" value="" /><br />
										<input type="submit" value="Log in" />
								</form>
						</p>
						<p>
								Let's suppose that in fetching this page a cookie has been
								set with a session ID.
								We are not going to fill the form in yet, just test that
								we are tracking the user.
								Here is the test...
<php><![CDATA[
class LogInTest extends WebTestCase {
		function testSessionCookieSetBeforeForm() {
				$this->get('http://www.my-site.com/login.php');<strong>
				$this->assertCookie('SID');</strong>
		}
}
]]></php>
								All we are doing is confirming that the cookie is set.
								As the value is likely to be rather cryptic it's not
								really worth testing this with...
<php><![CDATA[
class LogInTest extends WebTestCase {
		function testSessionCookieIsCorrectPattern() {
				$this->get('http://www.my-site.com/login.php');
				$this->assertCookie('SID', <strong>new PatternExpectation('/[a-f0-9]{32}/i')</strong>);
		}
}
]]></php>
								If you are using PHP to handle sessions for you then
								this test is even more useless, as we are just testing PHP itself.
						</p>
						<p>
								The simplest test of logging in is to visually inspect the
								next page to see if you are really logged in.
								Just test the next page with <code>WebTestCase::assertText()</code>.
						</p>
						<p>
								The test is similar to any other form test,
								but we might want to confirm that we still have the same
								cookie after log-in as before we entered.
								We wouldn't want to lose track of this after all.
								Here is a possible test for this...
<php><![CDATA[
class LogInTest extends WebTestCase {
		...
		function testSessionCookieSameAfterLogIn() {
				$this->get('http://www.my-site.com/login.php');<strong>
				$session = $this->getCookie('SID');
				$this->setField('u', 'Me');
				$this->setField('p', 'Secret');
				$this->click('Log in');
				$this->assertText('Welcome Me');
				$this->assertCookie('SID', $session);</strong>
		}
}
]]></php>
								This confirms that the session identifier is maintained
								afer log-in and we haven't accidently reset it.
						</p>
						<p>
								We could even attempt to hack our own system by setting
								arbitrary cookies to gain access...
<php><![CDATA[
class LogInTest extends WebTestCase {
		...
		function testSessionCookieSameAfterLogIn() {
				$this->get('http://www.my-site.com/login.php');<strong>
				$this->setCookie('SID', 'Some other session');
				$this->get('http://www.my-site.com/restricted.php');</strong>
				$this->assertText('Access denied');
		}
}
]]></php>
								Is your site protected from this attack?
						</p>
				</section>
				<section name="session" title="Browser sessions">
						<p>
								If you are testing an authentication system a critical piece
								of behaviour is what happens when a user logs back in.
								We would like to simulate closing and reopening a browser...
<php><![CDATA[
class LogInTest extends WebTestCase {
		...
		function testLoseAuthenticationAfterBrowserClose() {
				$this->get('http://www.my-site.com/login.php');
				$this->setField('u', 'Me');
				$this->setField('p', 'Secret');
				$this->click('Log in');
				$this->assertText('Welcome Me');<strong>

				$this->restart();
				$this->get('http://www.my-site.com/restricted.php');
				$this->assertText('Access denied');</strong>
		}
}
]]></php>
								The <code>WebTestCase::restart()</code> method will
								preserve cookies that have unexpired timeouts, but throw away
								those that are temporary or expired.
								You can optionally specify the time and date that the restart
								happened.
						</p>
						<p>
								Expiring cookies can be a problem.
								After all, if you have a cookie that expires after an hour,
								you don't want to stall the test for an hour while waiting
								for the cookie to pass it's timeout.
						</p>
						<p>
								To push the cookies over the hour limit you can age them
								before you restart the session...
<php><![CDATA[
class LogInTest extends WebTestCase {
		...
		function testLoseAuthenticationAfterOneHour() {
				$this->get('http://www.my-site.com/login.php');
				$this->setField('u', 'Me');
				$this->setField('p', 'Secret');
				$this->click('Log in');
				$this->assertText('Welcome Me');
				<strong>
				$this->ageCookies(3600);</strong>
				$this->restart();
				$this->get('http://www.my-site.com/restricted.php');
				$this->assertText('Access denied');
		}
}
]]></php>
								After the restart it will appear that cookies are an
								hour older, and any that pass their expiry will have
								disappeared.
