Why php 5.5? Is there any way we could keep php 5.4 support in 6.0, and drop it later?

@fabpot a new major version should be the time to get rid of the weird service location done when calling each parent constructor, which is totally ugly.

Any news on this @fabpot? This looks really nice as a starting point.

@GrahamCampbell I think I will need some help for the next steps. I will add some steps in the description so that everyone can take one and contribute to this 6.0 version.
