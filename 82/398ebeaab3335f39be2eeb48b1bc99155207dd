Shouldn't we also use `@fread()` now instead of `fread()` as the migration doc mention that it now raises a notice?

Since Swiftmailer is a library, I think that the error message should not be suppressed so that the user, which uses swiftmailer in his project, knows that there are for example insufficient permissions to that stream.
