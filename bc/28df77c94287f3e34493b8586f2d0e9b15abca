The reason why no builds are being run, most likely, is due to GitHub Actions still need to be enabled on this repository.

@driesvints Thank you so much for wokring on this. Actions are enabled, so I'm not sure why that does not work. Trying to figure it out.

@fabpot is there an "enable" button here? https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/actions

@driesvints It is enabled. Apparently, we need to have something on master first. So, can I merge this PR?
