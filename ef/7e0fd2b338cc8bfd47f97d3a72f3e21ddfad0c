You can also add the autoload entry as dev to composer.json, not sure if it works in this case (PSR-0 with underscored class).

```json
    "autoload-dev": {
        "psr-0": {
            "Swift_": "tests/unit"
        }
    },
```

Yeh, autoload-dev should be used here.

In any case, using require_once when you care about the return value is always wrong, as you have no guarantee to get the original return value (you would get ``true`` if it was already loaded previously)
